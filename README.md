# OOP Assignment: Classes, Inheritance & Polymorphism

## Assignment 1: Design Your Own Class
- Created a `Book` class with attributes: title, author, pages.
- Created a subclass `EBook` to demonstrate **inheritance** and **polymorphism**.
- Used constructors to initialize objects with unique values.

## Assignment 2: Polymorphism Challenge
- Created a base class `Vehicle` with a `move()` method.
- Subclasses `Car`, `Plane`, and `Boat` each override `move()` differently.
- Demonstrates **polymorphism** in action.
